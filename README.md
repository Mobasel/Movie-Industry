# Movie-Industry
### This project aims to analyze a dataset that contains data for the movie industry for the last four decades, and it's inspired by a project made by Alex the analyst on YouTube.
- We will find the correlation between the movie budget and the revenue.
- We will analyze the other factors inside the dataset to get insights like:
  - How much was the revenue for each company?
  - Which genre generated the most revenue over the past 4 decades?
  - Is there any relation between the rating and the revenue? / How much revenue did each rating group generate?

This dataset is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies
